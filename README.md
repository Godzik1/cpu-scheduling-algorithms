# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains simulation programs for CPU scheduling algorithms, specifically:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Longest-Completed-So-Far (LCSF)**

## ðŸ“Œ Description

CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems, determining the order in which processes are executed. This project provides Python implementations for FCFS and LCSF scheduling algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the simulations
To execute a scheduling algorithm, use:

```bash
python fcfs.py input_data.txt
